# Chapter 3 Topology

## Introduction

Infinite lines and planes are great, but also fairly limiting. We want to manufacture more than infinite planes and lines. We want to manufacture parts with holes, fillets, and other features. We want to manufacture parts with bounded surfaces and volumes. This is where topology comes in.

Topology is the study of properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, crumpling, and bending, but not tearing or gluing. In the context of computer-aided design, topology is the study of bounded sets, such as edges, faces, and volumes. Take a look at the following figure:
