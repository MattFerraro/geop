# Geometry

Geometry refers to structures that represent unbounded / inifinite objects, like planes, spheres, circles, lines, etc. These objects are used to define the shape of the objects in the scene. The simples case are curves.

> **Note**: For rendering, we have to somehow bound the geometry, as we cannot render infinite objects. Just ignore the points and the boundaries of the surfaces.
